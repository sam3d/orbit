# This shell script is a fast way to install Orbit on any linux server with only
# one command. It is designed to be executed with the command at the bottom of
# this comment block. Now, some of you may hate using "curl | bash" and that's
# totally fine. You can just download the script first and then execute it once
# you've been able to verify the contents of this file.
#
# curl https://get.orbit.sh | bash
